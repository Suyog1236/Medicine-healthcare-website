                <h2><b> Information about the generic drugs</b></h2>

                <h3>A generic drug is a medication created to be the same as an already marketed brand-name drug in
                    dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics, and
                    intended use. These similarities help to demonstrate bioequivalence, which means that a generic
                    medicine works in the same way and provides the same clinical benefit as the brand-name medicine.

                </h3>
                <h3>
                    It must be the same as a brand-name medicine in dosage, form and route of administration, safety,
                    effectiveness,
                    strength, and labeling (with certain limited exceptions). It must also meet the same high standards
                    of quality and manufacturing as the brand-name product, and it must be and quality, taken and used
                    in the same way as well. This standard applies to all generic medicines.

                    Generic medicines use the same active ingredients as brand-name medicines and work the same way, so
                    they have the same risks and benefits as the brand-name medicines. The FDA Generic Drugs Program
                    conducts a rigorous review to ensure generic medicines meet these standards, in addition to
                    conducting inspections of manufacturing plants and monitoring drug safety after the generic medicine
                    has been approved and brought to market.
